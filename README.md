# Project4: David's Contributions
<ol>
    <li>
        Created many different machine learning models and optimized a deep learning model using keras tuner with 72% validation accuracy, which was uploaded to the Webapp (https://data-insiders.web.app/) using Tensorflow.js
    </li>
    <li>
        Created a React App that showcases our deep learning model and different visualizations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Stored our csv file in AWS S3, uploaded it to Dynamo DB, and retrived the data using AWS API Gateway and Lambda function for data visualizations.
