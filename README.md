<h3> Introduction </h3>
Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) remains a leading cause of mortality globally. Identifying individuals at risk of developing CVD is crucial for preventive interventions. This project focuses on implementing a combination of machine learning techniques, SQL queries, and Tableau visualizations to analyze CVD risk factors and predict individuals' risk levels.

Repository Contents:

<h3> Data </h3>

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset/data

<h3> SQL Queries** </h3>

The SQL file comprises scripts for querying and preprocessing data from databases. These queries are essential for providing in depth insights of analyzig data.

<h3> Machine Learning Model </h3>

This section contains Python scripts implementing machine learning algorithms for CVD risk prediction. The models are trained on historical data and can be used to predict the likelihood of an individual developing CVD based on various features such as age, weight, height, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose levels and levels of activity.

We tried many different machine learning models, including logistic regression, Random Forests, and decision trees. We finally decided to use a multilayer perceptron beause it had the highest validation accuracy.

<h3> Tableau Visualizations </h3>

The Tableau link contains visualization files showcasing insights derived from the data analysis. These interactive dashboards provide a comprehensive overview of CVD risk factors and predictions.
